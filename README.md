# Neural-Network
This project has been developed for the Neural Network class. It is a Python library crafted to facilitate the creation, optimization, and validation of Neural Networks. It encompasses two optimizers, namely RMSProp and AdamW, alongside a range of activation functions and error functions.
### V 0.1.1 
By: @Dan1543
For this version the DNN is working, the input data should be in a format like the following:
| Speed | Fuel rate |
|-------|-----------|
| 45.3  | 43.2      |
| 20.15 | -3.1      |
| 23.5  |  12.4     |

For following versions it's planned to added L1,L2 and dropout regularizers, also to include the Nguyen-Widraw method for the weigths initialization, so take them in count for complicated datasets
